# Go Drone

A drone project in which the drone is controlled by a raspberry controlled DJI Naza V2 flight controller. The project builds up on three other projets off mine, the [robot communication interface](https://github.com/luickk/rcf), [goNazaV2Interface](https://github.com/luickk/goNazaV2Interface) and the [goDjiNazaGpsDecoder](https://github.com/luickk/goDjiNazaGpsDecoder).
